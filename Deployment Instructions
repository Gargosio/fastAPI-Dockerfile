-create the project folder i.e aqualytica
-write to your Dockerfile after chosing an empty port
-write to your requirements.txt file
-create the app folder and inside add your empty __init.py__ file and write to the main.py file
-Run the commands below while in the project folder:
	docker build -t <imagename> .   (dont leave out the "." it specifies you want to build the image in the current folder(the project folder i.e aqualytica))
	docker run -d --name <containername> -p 'portnumber':80 <imagename>
-Login to the registry and push your image using the following commands:
	docker login registry.digitalocean.com
	docker tag <imagename> registry.digitalocean.com/thinglooker/<imagename>   :(thinglooker is the registry name so it will always remain the same in this command)
	docker push registry.digitalocean.com/thinglooker/<imagename>	
-Go to DO App service and build the app based on the newly pushed image
-The deployment will fail due to Health check reasons after which you go back to the app - image component -HTTP port - change the port to the one specified in the 
 Dockerfile and the app will automatically deploy.
-Test the API on the web using 'GET' Url to see the data that currently sits in the DB
-SUCCESS!!

-Additional Docker commands:
	docker rmi <your-image-id> : removing an image
	docker rmi -f <your-image-id> : force removing an image
	docker stop <containerid> : stopping a container
	docker rm <containerid> : removing a container

-Additional Linux commands:
	CTRL + O then ENTER :Save changes in a file
	CTRL + X :Exit the file
